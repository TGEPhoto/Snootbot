Learn to light a candle in the darkest moments of someoneâ€™s life. Be the light that helps others see; it is what gives life its deepest significance.
Life is about accepting the challenges along the way, choosing to keep moving forward, and savoring the journey.
A random act of kindness, no matter how small, can make a tremendous impact on someone else's life.
Life becomes easier and more beautiful when we can see the good in other people.
Everyone is deserving of kindness. That includes you!
Follow your heart, listen to your inner voice, stop caring about what others think. You are you, if people cannot accept that they are not worth your time.
You have significance on this earth. Keep doing what you love and what you are passionate about, the world needs it.
Do what is right, not what is easy nor what
Accept yourself, love yourself, and keep moving forward. If you want to fly, you have to give up what weighs you down.
Everyone has flaws and imperfections. That's what makes the world so different and beautiful.
Be the reason someone smiles. Be the reason someone feels loved and believes in the goodness in people.
You have survived 100% of your bad days. You can survive this one too. You are a lot stronger than you think you are.
More smiling, less worrying. More compassion, less judgment. More blessed, less stressed. More love, less hate.
Instead of worrying about what you cannot control, shift your energy to what you can create.
Dont be pushed around by the fears in your mind. Be led by the dreams in your hear
